This AutoHotKey script is designed for users running Cyberpunk 2077 on GeForce Now (GFN), specifically targeting priority accounts that are unable to save graphics settings between sessions. When executed after the game has started, the script automatically sets the graphics to their default configuration and turns off motion blur. This ensures a consistent and optimized gaming experience each time you play, without the need to manually adjust settings.

How to Run the Script with AutoHotKey:

Download and Install AutoHotKey: If you haven't already, download and install AutoHotKey from the official website.

Raunning the Script:

After saving the file, simply double-click on the .ahk file you created.
The script will run in the background, automatically adjusting the graphics settings when Cyberpunk 2077 is running.
